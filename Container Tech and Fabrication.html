            <h2>CON-TECH & FABRICATION</h2>
            <p>In Kenya, the fabrication of shipping containers is revolutionizing the construction industry by promoting proper and efficient building practices. Ranging from lowered budgets and speedy construction periods to minimalist nature and exciting new designs, shipping containers are shifting the industry locally and internationally and introducing alternatives to traditional construction technologies.</p>
            
            <h2>Factors that Determine the Prices/Costs of Shipping Container Houses</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <h3>The distance to the construction site from urban centres or the fabrication location</h3>
                    <p>This will determine the costs of transporting the container(s), the personnel, and the raw materials to your location. The further you are from the source of these requirements the more you are likely to spend.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Type of soil/nature of the site ground</h3>
                    <p>In the world of freight containers, the foundation significantly affects the overall cost. You will pay more for foundation preparation if your site has dark cotton soil or is swampy. Remember that dark cotton soil is soft and has a high water retention capacity. As such, excavating will be deeper (4ft or 5ft deep) for the erection of concrete slab and or concrete pillars. It also means more materials will be consumed in erecting the foundation.</p><p>The same applies to steeply sloping ground. Normally, the lower end of the slope will require much more material fill-up to level with the upper end. On the other hand, you will incur lesser costs if your site is blessed with red volcanic soil and is gently sloping or generally flat. Red volcanic soils are firm, strong, and have low water retention capacity. As such, the excavation will not be deep (between 2ft and 2,5ft deep will be enough).</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Specifications used in putting up the container house</h3>
                    <p>Specifications are structural and design factors. Different clients prefer different specifications. We have listed them here:</p>
                    <ol type="a">
                        <li>
                            <h4>Size/type/number of doors and windows</h4>
                            <p>A house with similar spacing and design can have variations in the size, type, and number of doors and windows. Various types would include; French doors and windows, Glass doors and windows, aluminium sliding windows, and wooden doors and windows. Some builders prefer very large windows and twin doors, most prefer standard-sized windows and ordinary single doors. For some, wooden doors and windows are more appealing. It is from these differences that costs also vary.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h4>Materials used to cover the interior wall and ceiling</h4>
                            <p>Block boards, soft boards, plywood, and gypsum are some of these materials. Each of these comes at different costs.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h4>Floor Materials</h4>
                            <p>Some commonly used flooring materials for container houses include cement, epoxy spray, vortex, wood, vinyl, and ceramic tiles. Just like walling and ceiling coverings, these also have differences in cost.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h4>Structural Extensions and Additions</h4>
                            <p>Some container houses are made into storeys and will require staircases. Others will have foyers and verandas. Some have more than one container and will preferably be roofed. Depending on which of these are included or excluded from the final design, the costs will be affected. Notice also that as far as roofing is concerned, different types exist and each one bears the effects on the overall cost. Since the costs for transportation and foundation vary, we shall focus only on the container and the fabrication costs. This research is based on fabrication using the most common construction materials in Kenya; (examples include ceramic tiles for floor and washroom walls and gypsum boarding for walls and ceiling).</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h4>Costs for various container homes/houses</h4>
                            <p>Now that we got that out of the way, let&rsquo;s dive into the costs of different container houses in the Kenyan market, focusing on the container and fabrication costs.<br> In the Kenyan market, a bedsitter shipping container house unit will cost between Kshs. 550,000 to Kshs. 750,000. These are the smallest of self-contained houses. They are usually fabricated from 20 ft shipping containers. <p>At 20 ft long, 8 ft wide and 8 ft 6 inches high, the container provides enough space for a bedroom, a kitchen, washrooms, and a living room. With a kitchen, a living room, a bedroom, and washrooms all in tow, you will pay between Kshs. 950,000 and Kshs. 1,400,000 to obtain a one-bedroom unit. The approximate measurements for the one-bedroom container house are 40 ft long, 8 ft wide, and 9.6ft high for a High Cube 40 ft container.</p> <p>Two-bedroom houses from shipping containers in Kenya will cost between Kshs. 1.05 million and Kshs. 2 million. For minimalist living, two bedrooms can be fabricated from singular 40Ft shipping containers otherwise you’d need more than one for the various spaces. This is to say, you could combine two same-size containers or two varying containers depending on your needs. Combinations of 20ft and 40ft containers are prevalent from two-bedroom houses upwards.</p> <p>While these are the most in-demand, your 3-bedroom container house will cost anywhere from Kshs. 1.8 million to Kshs. 3.2 million. Normally, these homes are ideal for young urban nuclear families. Often, there is extra space for visiting or live-in guests.</p> <p>In Kenya, and using shipping containers as your base structures, a four-bedroom house will set you back anywhere from Kshs. 2.4 million to Kshs. 4 million. If you are the type that thinks long-term, then a four-bedroom home is perfect for you. The costs of using shipping containers are significantly less expensive compared to brick and mortar. Aside from them being affordable and highly flexible, they are exceedingly beautiful. While the costs of construction remain a major concern, builders want homes that are both exciting and have character regardless of whether it is outside or inside. They seek feelings of comfort, relaxation, recovery, and rejuvenation.</p>

            <h2>Advantages of Shipping Container Houses</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <h3>Net-Zero Additional Costs in Container Building</h3>
                    <p>Once you&rsquo;ve established a budget with your contractor, you can rest assured that there won&rsquo;t be any unforeseen additional expenses. Container fabrication is a standardized process, characterized by minimal disruptions and emergencies. The detailed quotations encompass costs for containers, interior insulation, electrical wiring, fittings, doors, windows, spray painting, and more.</p><p>The same applies to external structures, including washrooms, tanks, tank stands, foundation buildings, septic tanks, bio-digesters, fences, walls, delivery expenses, and landscaping. Standard budgets and timelines make it easy to monitor the construction process, material usage, savings, storage systems, labour, and utility systems. Contractors save you from the hassles of constant supervision, unexpected costs, emergencies, and contingencies.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Speed and Efficiency</h3>
                    <p>Container structures are incredibly fast to construct, often taking just a matter of weeks. A one-bedroom container house can be ready in as little as 10 days, while a two-bedroom one typically takes 14 days, and a three-bedroom house can be completed in 21 days.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Cost-Effectiveness of Container Fabrication</h3>
                    <p>Used shipping containers, constructed of robust steel, are among the most cost-effective building materials globally. When you consider the low costs of ceramic tiles and gypsum, commonly used in container construction, it becomes evident why the entire operation is significantly more budget-friendly than traditional concrete and mortar construction. Research comparing container fabrication to concrete buildings with similar designs and specifications found that containers are, on average, 33% cheaper.</p> <p>The key factors contributing to this cost-effectiveness include:
                        <ul>
                            <li>The cost-friendly nature of shipping containers.</li>
                            <li>The minimal requirement for fabrication materials and processes.</li>
                            <li>Gypsum, polystyrene, screws, cutting and grinding discs are cost-effective and readily available, with lower consumption per square surface area.</li>
                            <li>In partitioning and framing, a small quantity of steel bars covers large surface areas on walls, ceilings, and partitions.</li>
                            <li>The technical aspects of fabrication are efficiently conducted due to the standardized and simplified nature of containers, resulting in lower labour costs.</li>
                        </ul>
        
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Customizability and Customer-Specific Design</h3>
                    <p>The essence of construction is to provide customers with precisely what they desire, adhering to measurements, designs, and materials as specified in the contract without compromising quality or minimum standards. For interior insulation, clients have the flexibility to choose from a range of materials, such as gypsum, softboards, chipboards, wood, ISO panels, and EPS panels. Similarly, options for flooring vary from vinyl to ceramic tiles, wood, epoxy spray, cement, and marble. Various roofing designs, including gables, hips, flat roofs, saltboxes, mansards, bonnets, and pyramids, can be incorporated into container structures. The exterior surfaces of containers can be clad with wood, cement boards, ceramic tiles, steel sheets, or vinyl.</p><p>The versatility of container refurbishment makes it easier to meet these specifications, offering a wide range of economic possibilities for investors. Clients can envision and acquire models that align with specific concepts, budgets, and timelines.</p>

                    <h3>Exceptional Flexibility Offered by Container Fabrication</h3>
                    <p>When building houses, rental units, commercial spaces, or offices, you can start with a single container unit and expand by adding more units laterally or spatially. What initially begins as a single establishment can quickly evolve into a complex comprising several compartments. Additionally, cuttings from containers can be joined to create extensions like verandas, car parks, storage spaces, and attics.</p><p>The process of joining and separating containers is straightforward, allowing previously joined units to be moved to new locations and reassembled to match the original design. This level of flexibility is unparalleled in comparison to other building materials. Container flexibility has even enabled clients to lease land for temporary container structures that can be easily relocated between sites. Moreover, branded containers can be mounted on trucks for brand recognition and advertising, which is particularly valuable in Kenya’s nomadic culture.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>High Aesthetic Value on the Final Product</h3>
                    <p>Gypsum is widely regarded as one of the most aesthetically pleasing interior materials due to its malleability. It’s extensively used in interior finishes on container walls and ceilings, as it can be moulded into various patterns, including triangles, flower patterns, letters, numbers, and logos. Moreover, containers, often sourced by organizations, can be easily branded with logos, paint patterns, and images for recognition and advertising.</p><p>In Kenya, various entities, including corporations, politicians, celebrities, and investors, have effectively utilized beautifully branded and colourful containers as a means of mass communication.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Durability, Environmental Friendliness, and Ease of Maintenance of Container Fabricated Structures</h3>
                    <p>Shipping containers are known for their robustness and weight, with empty 20-foot containers weighing 2,000 kilograms and 40-foot containers weighing 4,000 kilograms. Their steel corner beams and rigid walls enhance their strength and stability, allowing them to withstand extreme weather conditions, including storms, salinity, rainfall, sun, and floods. Fabricating structures with shipping containers ensures a solid, reliable shelter that can endure for centuries, protecting occupants.</p><p>Additionally, maintaining container surfaces is straightforward, involving cleaning and repainting processes similar to those for conventional buildings. A well-painted container structure can last up to five years before requiring repainting. Any rare repairs that may be necessary can be conducted quickly and affordably, thanks to the thin walls of container structures, which are easily manoeuvred, cut, and replaced by technicians.</p>
